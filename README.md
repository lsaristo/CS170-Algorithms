Classification Algorithms
=========================

Simplified Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors classifier algorithms and a DNA short read greedy reconstructor algorithm, all written as homework projects for Computer Science 170 at UC Berkeley.

Files:

* KNN.cs - K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Written in C# with DataStructure.cs, Driver.cs as support files.
* RandomForest.py - Random Forest classifier, written in Python.
* DnaRead.py - DNA Short read reconstruction. Greedy algorithm written in Python.
